            Hi! I'm Andrew, a full-stack developer based in Granville, Ohio. I'm
            currently a junior at Denison University, studying Computer Science.
            When I'm not working on projects, you can find me playing music.
            I've been playing the saxophone for almost 10 years and recently
            picked up the guitar. I also have a love for plantsâ€”I keep a variety
            in my dorm! If you ever want to talk about music or plants, feel
            free to reach out.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4">
            In my work, I strive to build applications that are accessible,
            scalable, and clean. I often use{" "}
            <span className="text-emerald-400 font-bold">React</span> and{" "}
            <span className="text-emerald-400 font-bold">Tailwind</span> for
            frontend development, along with{" "}

            <span className="text-emerald-400 font-bold">Node.js</span> for the
            backend. I'm always eager to explore new technologies and make
            continuous efforts to expand my knowledge.
